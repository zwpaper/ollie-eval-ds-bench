# A First-Class Money Type for Ash

## Background

`/home/user/ledger` is an Elixir 1.18 / OTP 27 project (OTP app `:ledger`) that already depends on `ash` 3.31.0 and `jason`. Every dependency is vendored and pre-compiled, and the project must keep building **entirely offline** — nothing may be fetched. You may not add, remove or upgrade dependencies, and the money libraries `ash_money` / `ex_money` are deliberately unavailable — the value type is yours to build.

The project currently contains only the mix project, the config, and an empty Ash domain `Ledger.Billing` (already registered in `config/config.exs`). Everything described below is missing.

Build an exact-integer money value, expose it to Ash as a real custom type, and model a small billing domain on top of it.

## Requirements

### 1. The money value — `Ledger.Money`

A struct with exactly two fields, `:currency` (an atom) and `:amount` (an integer count of *minor units*).

Supported currencies and their minor-unit exponents:

| currency | code | exponent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `:bhd` | `BHD` | 3 |
| `:eur` | `EUR` | 2 |
| `:jpy` | `JPY` | 0 |
| `:usd` | `USD` | 2 |

**Canonical string form**: the uppercase code, one space, then the amount in major units using exactly `exponent` fraction digits (no decimal point at all when the exponent is 0). A negative amount carries a single `-` immediately before the first digit. Examples: `"USD 12.50"`, `"USD -0.05"`, `"USD 0.00"`, `"JPY 500"`, `"JPY -7"`, `"BHD 1.234"`, `"BHD -0.001"`.

Public API of `Ledger.Money` (exact names and arities):

- `currencies/0` → `[:bhd, :eur, :jpy, :usd]`, in that order.
- `exponent/1` — takes a supported currency atom, returns its exponent as an integer.
- `new/2` — `new(amount, currency)`; returns `{:ok, money}`, or `{:error, :invalid_amount}` when `amount` is not an integer, or `{:error, :unknown_currency}` when the currency is not supported.
- `new!/2` — same arguments, returns the money value or raises `ArgumentError`.
- `zero/1` — `zero(currency)` returns the money value with amount `0`.
- `add/2` and `subtract/2` — `{:ok, money}`, or `{:error, :currency_mismatch}` when the two operands differ in currency.
- `multiply/2` — `multiply(money, factor)`; `{:ok, money}` for an integer factor, `{:error, :invalid_factor}` otherwise.
- `sum/2` — `sum(list_of_money, currency)`; `{:ok, money}` (an empty list sums to zero of that currency), or `{:error, :currency_mismatch}` if any element uses a different currency.
- `compare/2` — returns `:lt`, `:eq` or `:gt`, and raises `ArgumentError` when the currencies differ.
- `to_string/1` — the canonical string form.

All arithmetic is exact integer arithmetic; no floats, no rounding, no truncation.

### 2. The Ash type — `Ledger.Money.Type`

An `Ash.Type` whose valid instances are `Ledger.Money` structs. Its storage type must be `:map`.

**Accepted inputs**, all of which must produce the same value when they denote the same money:

- `nil` (which stays `nil`),
- a `Ledger.Money` struct,
- a map carrying a currency and an amount under *either* the atom keys `:currency` / `:amount` *or* the string keys `"currency"` / `"amount"` (a map missing either one is invalid),
- the canonical string form.

A currency may be supplied as a supported atom, or as a string whose upcased form is a supported code (`"usd"` and `"USD"` are both accepted). An amount may be supplied as an integer or as a string matching `^-?[0-9]+$`.

The currency is resolved **before** the amount: if the currency is unsupported, the currency error is reported even when the amount is also unusable.

**Every** cast failure returns `{:error, keyword}` where the keyword starts with `message:` and also carries `reason:`:

| situation | `message` | `reason` | extra entry |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| currency not supported | `"unknown currency"` | `:unknown_currency` | `currency:` — the rejected value exactly as it was supplied |
| amount is a float, or a string matching `^-?[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$` | `"amount must be a whole number of minor units"` | `:fractional_minor_units` | — |
| anything else that cannot be interpreted | `"invalid money format"` | `:invalid_format` | — |

A canonical string whose fraction-digit count does not match the currency's exponent is an `:invalid_format` failure.

Loading a stored value must accept exactly what the type writes to storage and report `:invalid_format` for anything else. The stored form must round-trip losslessly, and it must still round-trip losslessly after being encoded and decoded with `Jason`.

**Constraints** (these exact option names must be supported):

- `:currencies` — the list of currency atoms that are allowed,
- `:min` and `:max` — inclusive bounds, supplied in any of the accepted input shapes,
- `:multiple_of` — a positive integer; the amount must be an exact multiple of it.

Constraint violations also return `{:error, keyword}` with `message:` and `reason:`, and the checks are applied in the order `:currencies`, `:multiple_of`, `:min`, `:max` (the first failure wins):

| situation | `message` | `reason` | extra entry |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| currency outside `:currencies` | `"currency is not allowed"` | `:currency_not_allowed` | `currency:` — the value's currency atom |
| amount is not a multiple | `"must be a multiple of %{multiple_of} minor units"` | `:not_multiple_of` | `multiple_of:` — the constraint value |
| below `:min` | `"must be greater than or equal to %{min}"` | `:below_min` | `min:` — the canonical string of the bound |
| above `:max` | `"must be less than or equal to %{max}"` | `:above_max` | `max:` — the canonical string of the bound |
| a bound's currency differs from the value's | `"cannot compare money in different currencies"` | `:currency_mismatch` | — |

The currency-mismatch outcome replaces the corresponding `:min` / `:max` verdict.

### 3. The narrowed type — `Ledger.Money.Usd`

An `Ash.Type.NewType` whose subtype is `Ledger.Money.Type` and which bakes in these constraints: only `:usd` is allowed, the inclusive minimum is `USD 0.00`, and the inclusive maximum is `USD 10000.00`. Attributes typed with it must enforce those bounds without repeating them.

### 4. The billing resources

Both resources use `Ash.DataLayer.Ets` with **private** tables, and belong to the existing domain `Ledger.Billing`.

`Ledger.Billing.Invoice`

- Attributes: `:id` (uuid primary key), `:reference` (`:string`, required), `:subtotal` (`Ledger.Money.Type`, required, restricted to `:usd`, `:eur` and `:jpy`), `:adjustments` (an array of `Ledger.Money.Type` defaulting to `[]`, where every element must be a multiple of 5 minor units), `:credit_limit` (`Ledger.Money.Usd`, optional).
- A `:payments` relationship to `Ledger.Billing.Payment`.
- An aggregate `:paid_minor` — the sum of the payments' stored minor-unit amounts, which is `0` when there are no payments.
- A calculation `:total` of type `Ledger.Money.Type` — the subtotal plus every adjustment.
- A calculation `:balance` of type `Ledger.Money.Type` — the total minus everything paid.
- Every adjustment must use the subtotal's currency. A violation must fail with `Ash.Error.Changes.InvalidAttribute` on field `:adjustments` carrying the message `"must all use the currency of the subtotal"`.
- Actions: the default `:read` and `:destroy`; a create action `:issue` accepting `:reference`, `:subtotal`, `:adjustments` and `:credit_limit`; an update action `:apply_adjustment` taking a required argument `:adjustment` of the money type and appending it to `:adjustments`; and a generic action `:price_for` that returns `Ledger.Money.Type` and takes a required `:unit_price` (money) and a required `:units` (`:integer`), returning the unit price multiplied by the unit count.
- `:apply_adjustment` must reject an adjustment whose currency differs from the invoice's subtotal with `Ash.Error.Changes.InvalidArgument` on field `:adjustment` carrying the message `"must use the currency of the subtotal"`, and must leave the stored record untouched.

`Ledger.Billing.Payment`

- Attributes: `:id` (uuid primary key), `:amount` (`Ledger.Money.Type`, required, restricted to `:usd`, `:eur` and `:jpy`), `:amount_minor` (`:integer`), `:amount_currency` (`:atom`), and a required `belongs_to` `:invoice` whose `:invoice_id` is writable.
- Actions: the default `:read` and `:destroy`, plus a create action `:record` that accepts only `:amount` and `:invoice_id`. `:amount_minor` and `:amount_currency` are always derived from `:amount` and can never be supplied by the caller.
- `:amount_minor` is a plain integer column, so it is filterable and summable with ordinary expressions.

### 5. Domain code interface

`Ledger.Billing` must expose these functions:

- `issue_invoice(params)` and `issue_invoice!(params)`
- `get_invoice(id)` and `get_invoice!(id)` — fetch a single invoice by primary key
- `list_invoices()` and `list_invoices!()`
- `apply_adjustment(invoice, adjustment)` and `apply_adjustment!(invoice, adjustment)`
- `price_for(unit_price, units)` and `price_for!(unit_price, units)`
- `record_payment(params)` and `record_payment!(params)`

### 6. Querying

Ascending sorting on `:subtotal` must order invoices of one currency by their amount ascending (so `USD 9.00` comes before `USD 100.00`), descending sorting must reverse that, and an equality filter on `:subtotal` against a money value must match only records whose currency *and* amount both agree.

## Implementation Hints

- Project path: `/home/user/ledger`.
- Do not add, remove, change or fetch dependencies, and do not modify `mix.exs`, `mix.lock` or the `deps/` and `_build/` directories. `ash_money` and `ex_money` must not be used.
- Everything lives in the existing OTP app `:ledger` under `/home/user/ledger/lib`, and `mix compile` must succeed from `/home/user/ledger`.
- Verification loads the compiled application and drives your modules directly through the public Ash APIs (`Ash.Type.*`, `Ash.Query`, `Ash.load/2`, `Ash.read/1`) and through the `Ledger.Billing` code-interface functions listed above, so those names, arities and result shapes must match exactly.
- Error keywords returned by the type are compared entry by entry: the `message` value is compared verbatim, including any `%{...}` placeholder, which is never interpolated by your code.
- Money values compare equal only when both the currency and the amount agree.
