# Godot 4 — NavigationAgent2D With Dynamic NavigationObstacle2D Carving

## Background
Build a Godot 4 navigation demo where a `CharacterBody2D` agent uses `NavigationAgent2D` to reach a goal across a `NavigationRegion2D`-baked walkable area. The walkable mesh must be carved by `NavigationObstacle2D` nodes whose positions can change at runtime, requiring the navigation polygon to be re-baked so a new path can be found and the agent eventually fires `target_reached` at the goal.

## Requirements
- Build a runnable Godot 4 project that combines `NavigationRegion2D` baking, `NavigationAgent2D` path following, dynamic `NavigationObstacle2D` carving, and the `target_reached` signal.
- Define a packed scene `res://scenes/nav_world.tscn` that wires together the region, agent, obstacles, and goal marker described in the Acceptance Criteria.
- Provide a `NavWorld` controller node that can re-bake the navigation polygon (after obstacle moves) and start the navigation toward the goal.
- Provide a `NavAgent` `CharacterBody2D` script that drives the agent toward `NavigationAgent2D.get_next_path_position()` each physics tick and exposes a `reached` flag that flips to `true` exactly when `target_reached` fires.
- Movement must use the real `NavigationServer2D` map (not teleporting): each physics tick the agent reads the next path position from the navigation agent and integrates velocity with `move_and_slide()`.
- The agent must reach the goal both when obstacles block the straight line (forcing the path around) and after `NavWorld.move_obstacle(...)` clears the corridor and re-bakes.

## Implementation Hints
- Use `NavigationMeshSourceGeometryData2D` together with `NavigationServer2D.bake_from_source_geometry_data` to (re)build the `NavigationPolygon` so that obstacle outlines are carved out of the walkable rectangle.
- The walkable area is the rectangle from `(0, 0)` to `(800, 600)`. Add the walkable outline as a traversable outline and each obstacle's world-space outline as an obstruction outline.
- Wait for `NavigationServer2D.map_get_iteration_id(...)` to become non-zero (and skip queries before that) before driving the agent, otherwise `get_next_path_position()` returns stale data.
- `NavigationAgent2D` exposes the `target_reached` signal; connect it once and store a boolean flag so the verifier can observe completion.
- For obstacle outlines, store each obstacle's local `vertices` (a `PackedVector2Array`) and translate them by the obstacle's `global_position` before feeding them into the source geometry data.
- Run the project with `godot --headless` for verification; do not rely on rendering.
- Command: `godot --headless --path /home/user/godot_project --script res://tests/run_tests.gd` (verifier-provided harness; do not modify it).
