# Threaded Discussion Graph — Computed Relationships & Custom Actions (Ash Framework v3)

## Background

`/home/user/thread_graph` is an Elixir application (OTP app `:thread_graph`) that already compiles.
It uses **Ash Framework v3.31** with the in-memory `Ash.DataLayer.Ets` data layer and contains a
finished skeleton of a discussion board:

- Domain `ThreadGraph.Forum`
- `ThreadGraph.Forum.Author` — `handle`, `display_name`
- `ThreadGraph.Forum.Thread` — `slug`, `title`, `board`, `locked`, `has_many :messages`
- `ThreadGraph.Forum.Message` — `body`, `position` (integer), `score` (integer),
  `belongs_to :thread`, `belongs_to :author`, `belongs_to :parent` (self-reference through
  `parent_id`), `has_many :replies`
- `ThreadGraph.Forum.MessageLink` — a directed edge between two messages:
  `belongs_to :from_message`, `belongs_to :to_message`, `kind`
  (one of `:follow_up`, `:duplicate_of`, `:fork_of`)
- `ThreadGraph.Forum.LoadCounter` — a small global counter helper (see below)

Product now wants threading and a "related work" graph on top of this. None of the required
associations can be expressed as ordinary foreign-key relationships, so the framework's escape
hatches have to be used — while still behaving like first-class relationships and actions
(loadable, nestable, batched, and reachable through the domain's code interface).

**Do not change** the existing attribute names, relationship names, resource module names, the
domain module name, or `ThreadGraph.Forum.LoadCounter`. Everything listed below is additive.

## Requirements

Add the following to the existing resources.

### 1. Aggregate `reply_count` on `ThreadGraph.Forum.Message`

A public aggregate named `reply_count` that yields the number of messages whose `parent_id` is that
message's `id`. It must be loadable both directly and as part of a nested load.

### 2. Relationship `recent_messages` on `ThreadGraph.Forum.Thread`

A public `has_many`-style relationship to `ThreadGraph.Forum.Message` named `recent_messages`,
whose behaviour is implemented by the module `ThreadGraph.Forum.Threads.RecentMessages`.
`Ash.Resource.Info.relationship(ThreadGraph.Forum.Thread, :recent_messages)` must report
`type: :has_many`, `destination: ThreadGraph.Forum.Message`, and it must report
`ThreadGraph.Forum.Threads.RecentMessages` as the module implementing it (a bare module or a
`{module, opts}` pair are both accepted).

Contract, for each source thread independently:

- the value is that thread's own messages, ordered by `position` **descending**, ties broken by
  `id` **ascending** (Elixir term comparison of the `id` values), truncated to **at most 3**;
- the truncation is per thread — never a global cap over all source threads;
- a filter present on the load query is applied to the candidate messages **before** the
  truncation to 3;
- the ordering and the cap of 3 defined here are part of the contract and are not affected by a
  sort or limit present on the load query;
- a thread with no matching message must still be present in the result with `[]`.

### 3. Relationship `ancestor_messages` on `ThreadGraph.Forum.Message`

A public `has_many`-style relationship to `ThreadGraph.Forum.Message` named `ancestor_messages`,
implemented by the module `ThreadGraph.Forum.Messages.AncestorMessages`, reported by
`Ash.Resource.Info.relationship/2` the same way as above.

Contract, for each source message independently:

- the value is the transitive chain of parents reached by repeatedly following `parent_id`;
- ordering is outermost ancestor **first**, the immediate parent **last**;
- the source message itself is never included, and no message appears twice;
- traversal must terminate on a cyclic `parent_id` chain: stop as soon as the next hop is a message
  that has already been collected or is the source message itself;
- a message with `parent_id == nil` must be present in the result with `[]`.

### 4. Relationship `linked_messages` on `ThreadGraph.Forum.Message`

A public `has_many`-style relationship to `ThreadGraph.Forum.Message` named `linked_messages`,
implemented by the module `ThreadGraph.Forum.Messages.LinkedMessages`, reported by
`Ash.Resource.Info.relationship/2` the same way as above.

Contract, for each source message independently:

- consider the directed graph whose edges are the `ThreadGraph.Forum.MessageLink` records, pointing
  from `from_message_id` to `to_message_id`, **regardless of `kind`**;
- the value is every message reachable from the source message in one or more hops;
- each reachable message appears exactly once and is associated with its **minimum** hop distance
  from the source;
- the source message itself is never included, even when a cycle makes it reachable;
- ordering: minimum hop distance **ascending**, then `position` **ascending**, then `id`
  **ascending**;
- a message with no outgoing edge must be present in the result with `[]`.

### 5. Read action `cross_board_highlights` on `ThreadGraph.Forum.Message`

A read action named `cross_board_highlights`, implemented by the module
`ThreadGraph.Forum.Messages.CrossBoardHighlights`, which
`Ash.Resource.Info.action(ThreadGraph.Forum.Message, :cross_board_highlights)` must report as the
module implementing the action (bare module or `{module, opts}`).

Arguments, exactly:

| name | type | required | default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `boards` | `{:array, :string}` | yes | — |
| `min_endorsements` | `:integer` | no | `0` |

Define the **endorsement count** of a message `M` as the number of `ThreadGraph.Forum.MessageLink`
records whose `to_message_id` is `M.id` **and** whose `kind` is `:follow_up`.

Contract:

- the result contains exactly those messages whose thread's `board` is one of `boards` **and**
  whose endorsement count is greater than or equal to `min_endorsements`;
- every returned message carries its endorsement count as record metadata under the key
  `:endorsement_count`, so that `Ash.Resource.get_metadata(message, :endorsement_count)` returns
  that integer;
- when the incoming query carries no sort, the result is ordered by endorsement count
  **descending**, then `position` **ascending**, then `id` **ascending**;
- when the incoming query carries a sort, that sort replaces the default ordering above;
- a filter carried by the incoming query must be honoured;
- `limit` and `offset` carried by the incoming query must be honoured, and must be applied after
  filtering and ordering.

### 6. Create action `fork` on `ThreadGraph.Forum.Thread`

A create action named `fork` that accepts no attributes, implemented by the module
`ThreadGraph.Forum.Threads.ForkThread`, which
`Ash.Resource.Info.action(ThreadGraph.Forum.Thread, :fork)` must report as the module implementing
the action (bare module or `{module, opts}`).

Arguments, exactly: `source_message_id` (`:uuid`, required), `slug` (`:string`, required),
`title` (`:string`, required).

Let `S` be the message whose `id` is `source_message_id`. On success the action must, in one call:

- create and return a new `ThreadGraph.Forum.Thread` whose `slug` and `title` are the given
  arguments, whose `board` is copied from `S`'s thread, and whose `locked` is `false`;
- copy `S` **and every transitive descendant of `S`** (following `parent_id`) into the new thread —
  and nothing else. Each copy keeps the `body`, `score` and `author_id` of its original, and gets
  `thread_id` set to the new thread;
- reproduce the parent/child structure among the copies: the copy of `S` has `parent_id == nil`,
  and every other copy's `parent_id` is the id of the copy of its original's parent;
- renumber `position` on the copies: sort the copied originals by `position` ascending, ties broken
  by `id` ascending, and give the copies the positions `1, 2, 3, …` in that order;
- create exactly one new `ThreadGraph.Forum.MessageLink` with `kind: :fork_of`, `from_message_id`
  set to the id of the copy of `S`, and `to_message_id` set to `S.id`.

Failure modes — in both cases `Ash.create/2` must return `{:error, %Ash.Error.Invalid{}}` whose
`errors` list contains an `%Ash.Error.Changes.InvalidArgument{}` with `field: :source_message_id`
and the exact `message` given below, and **no** record of any resource may be created:

- no message with that id exists → message `"source message not found"`;
- `S`'s thread has `locked == true` → message `"source thread is locked"`.

### 7. Code interface on the domain `ThreadGraph.Forum`

- `ThreadGraph.Forum.highlights/2,3,4` and `ThreadGraph.Forum.highlights!/2,3,4` calling
  `cross_board_highlights`, taking `boards` then `min_endorsements` as positional arguments;
- `ThreadGraph.Forum.fork_thread/3,4,5` and `ThreadGraph.Forum.fork_thread!/3,4,5` calling `fork`,
  taking `source_message_id`, `slug`, then `title` as positional arguments.

`ThreadGraph.Forum.highlights!(boards, min_endorsements)` must return exactly what running the read
action through `Ash.Query`/`Ash.read!` returns.

## Implementation Hints

- Project path: `/home/user/thread_graph`. The project must compile cleanly with `mix compile`
  (`MIX_ENV=dev`); the verifier evaluates Elixir inside this project with `mix run`.
- Everything must keep working with the existing `Ash.DataLayer.Ets` data layer. No new
  dependencies may be added — the environment is offline and `mix.lock` is fixed.
- `ThreadGraph.Forum.LoadCounter` is already implemented and **must not be modified**. Its API is
  `reset/0`, `bump/1` (an atom key), `count/1` (an atom key → integer) and `counts/0` (a map).
  Each of the five modules you write must call `ThreadGraph.Forum.LoadCounter.bump/1`
  **exactly once per invocation of the callback the framework calls on it**, with these keys:

  | module | key |
  | --- | --- |
  | `ThreadGraph.Forum.Threads.RecentMessages` | `:recent_messages` |
  | `ThreadGraph.Forum.Messages.AncestorMessages` | `:ancestor_messages` |
  | `ThreadGraph.Forum.Messages.LinkedMessages` | `:linked_messages` |
  | `ThreadGraph.Forum.Messages.CrossBoardHighlights` | `:cross_board_highlights` |
  | `ThreadGraph.Forum.Threads.ForkThread` | `:fork` |

- Loading `recent_messages`, `ancestor_messages` or `linked_messages` for a list of `K` source
  records must issue **at most 8 read actions in total across all resources, independent of `K`**.
  The verifier counts this for real by attaching a `:telemetry` handler to
  `[:ash, :forum, :read, :stop]` around the load, with `K` of at least 13. Per-source-record
  querying will fail this.
- All three relationships and the aggregate must be `public?`, must be loadable through
  `Ash.Query.load/2` and through `Ash.load/3` on an already-fetched list of records, and must
  survive being nested: the verifier loads normal relationships, the `reply_count` aggregate and
  another one of the three relationships above *underneath* `recent_messages`.
- Result values are compared by `id`, by exact list ordering and by list length, so empty results
  must be `[]` (not `nil` and not `%Ash.NotLoaded{}`).
- The seeded data used by the verifier is created through the resources' existing default
  `:create`/`:update` actions, so those must keep working unchanged. Message `id`s are
  server-generated UUID strings, so every ordering rule that mentions `id` must compare the actual
  attribute values rather than insertion order.
