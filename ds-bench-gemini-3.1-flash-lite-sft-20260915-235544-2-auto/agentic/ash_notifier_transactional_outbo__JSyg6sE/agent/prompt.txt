# Transactional Outbox and Event Fan-out on Ash Framework v3

## Background

An Elixir project using **Ash Framework 3.31** lives at `/home/user/outbox`. It already models a tiny
ledger: the domain `Outbox.Ledger` with the resources `Outbox.Ledger.Account` and
`Outbox.Ledger.Transfer`, both backed by the in-memory ETS data layer. Today those writes leave no
trace — nothing downstream can learn that they happened.

Your job is to add an **outbox + fan-out** subsystem to the application. Every successful write to a
ledger resource must be captured as an ordered outbox entry, and a local dispatcher process must
hand those entries to interested subscribers with at-least-once delivery, bounded retries and a
dead-letter path. Everything runs inside this one application: no broker, no database, no network.

## Requirements

### 1. Outbox capture

* Every **successful** write (create, update or destroy) against a ledger resource appends exactly
  one entry to the outbox. Reads never produce entries.
* A write that fails (validation error, or any other error) must leave **no** entry behind, and a
  partially-failing batch write must produce entries only for the rows that actually succeeded.
* Capture must be driven by the framework's post-commit resource-notification mechanism rather than
  by code hand-written into each action. As a direct consequence, a caller that asks Ash to hand the
  notifications back instead of dispatching them (the documented per-call option for exactly that)
  must see the write succeed while producing **no** outbox entry.
* Batch writes must produce exactly one entry per successfully written record — never zero, never
  duplicated.

### 2. Outbox entry contents

Each entry records the action name, the resource, the record id, the acting actor, the attribute
diff, and two sequence numbers: a **global** one and a **per-aggregate** one.

* `sequence` — global, starts at `1`, increases by exactly `1` per entry, never repeats.
* `aggregate_sequence` — starts at `1` for each distinct aggregate (a pair of aggregate type and
  record id) and increases by exactly `1` for each further entry about that same aggregate.
* Both counters must stay correct when many processes write concurrently, including many concurrent
  writes to the *same* record.

### 3. Local dispatcher

A supervised, long-lived process fans entries out to subscribers. Subscribers are registered at
runtime under an id, with a topic pattern and a handler function. Delivery is per
`(entry, subscriber)` pair:

* A subscriber only ever receives entries whose topic matches its pattern, and only entries created
  **after** it subscribed (replay aside).
* An acknowledged delivery is never repeated, no matter how many drain passes happen afterwards.
* A delivery that is not acknowledged is retried on later drain passes, up to a hard maximum of
  **3 attempts** in total; after the third failed attempt it stops being retried and is recorded as
  a dead letter instead.
* A handler that raises must be contained: it counts as one failed attempt and must not take the
  dispatcher down or disturb any other delivery.
* Two delivery modes must be supported, and they must differ observably:
  * `:sync` — the handler runs immediately, **in the process that performed the write**, before the
    write call returns.
  * `:async` — the handler is not run at the time of the write at all; it runs later, **in the
    dispatcher process**, when a drain is requested.
  * A `:sync` handler that does not acknowledge is not lost: the delivery joins the pending queue
    and is retried exactly like an `:async` one, with the attempt it already burned counted.
* Within one drain pass, deliveries are attempted in ascending `sequence`; when one entry matches
  several subscribers, they are attempted in the order the subscribers were registered. This is what
  gives per-aggregate ordering to a healthy subscriber.
* Draining is caller-driven and must be fully deterministic: the drain request performs exactly one
  attempt for each currently-pending delivery and only returns once that pass is complete. Nothing
  may be delivered on a timer or in the background.

### 4. Replay

The outbox must be replayable: given a sequence number and a subscriber id, every stored entry after
that sequence whose topic matches that subscriber is re-delivered to it in ascending sequence order,
synchronously, in the caller's process — regardless of whether it was already acknowledged, and
regardless of the subscriber's delivery mode. Replay never enqueues retries and never dead-letters.
This capability must be exposed as a **generic action** on the outbox resource.

## Implementation Hints

Project path: `/home/user/outbox`. Ash 3.31 is already vendored; the environment is offline, so do
not try to add or fetch dependencies. `mix compile` must succeed and emit no errors.

**Topics.** A topic is exactly three dot-separated segments: `ledger.<aggregate_type>.<action_name>`,
where `<aggregate_type>` is the snake_case of the last segment of the resource module name
(`Outbox.Ledger.Account` → `account`, `Outbox.Ledger.Transfer` → `transfer`) and `<action_name>` is
the name of the action that ran. Example: `ledger.account.freeze`.

**Pattern matching.** A subscriber pattern is also dot-separated. A literal segment matches only an
identical segment — there is no partial or prefix matching inside a segment. `*` matches exactly one
segment. `#` is only legal as the final segment and matches zero or more remaining segments. If the
pattern contains no `#`, it matches only topics with the same number of segments.

**The outbox resource** is `Outbox.Eventing.Event`, in a new domain `Outbox.Eventing` (register it in
the application's Ash domain configuration), stored in the ETS data layer with a UUID primary key
`:id` and these public attributes:

| attribute | type | notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sequence` | `:integer` | global counter described above |
| `aggregate_sequence` | `:integer` | per-aggregate counter described above |
| `topic` | `:string` | as defined above |
| `resource` | `:string` | the resource module's name without the `Elixir.` prefix, e.g. `"Outbox.Ledger.Account"` |
| `aggregate_type` | `:string` | e.g. `"account"` |
| `aggregate_id` | `:string` | the written record's primary key |
| `action` | `:atom` | the action name |
| `actor_id` | `:string` | see below; `nil` when there is no actor |
| `changes` | `:map` | see below |
| `dedup_key` | `:string` | `"<aggregate_type>:<aggregate_id>:<action>:<aggregate_sequence>"` |

`dedup_key` must additionally be protected by a resource identity named `:unique_dedup_key` over
`[:dedup_key]`, so that a duplicate entry can never be stored. The resource must also expose a
primary create action that accepts all of the attributes listed above and a primary read action.

`actor_id` is the value of the actor's `:id` key when the write was given an actor that has one and
that value is a binary; otherwise `nil`.

`changes` is a map keyed by **attribute name as a string**, whose values are maps with exactly the
two string keys `"from"` and `"to"`. Encoding of a value: `nil` stays `nil`, an atom becomes
`Atom.to_string/1`, anything else is stored unchanged. Which attributes appear:

* create — every public, non-primary-key attribute of the created record whose value is not `nil`,
  with `"from" => nil`;
* update — every public, non-primary-key attribute whose value actually differs between the record
  the action started from and the record it produced, with the before value under `"from"` and the
  after value under `"to"`. Ash does not hand the pre-action record to notifications produced by a
  *batch* update, so for entries coming from a batch update only the `"to"` value of each attribute
  the action set has to be correct;
* destroy — always the empty map `%{}`.

**Dispatcher.** The process is registered under the name `Outbox.Eventing.Dispatcher`, is started as
a child of the application's top-level supervisor `Outbox.Supervisor`, and exposes:

* `subscribe(subscriber_id :: atom(), pattern :: String.t(), handler :: (Event.t() -> :ok | {:error, term()}), opts :: keyword())`
  — must be callable with 3 or 4 arguments; the only option is `:mode`, which is `:sync` or `:async`
  and defaults to `:async`. Returns `:ok`, or `{:error, :already_subscribed}` if that id is taken.
* `unsubscribe(subscriber_id :: atom()) :: :ok` — always `:ok`; the subscriber's still-pending
  deliveries are discarded, its dead letters are kept.
* `flush() :: :ok` — perform exactly one drain pass, as described above.
* `dead_letters() :: [map()]` — every dead-lettered delivery as a map containing at least the keys
  `:subscriber_id`, `:sequence`, `:attempts` and `:reason`, sorted by `:sequence` ascending and, for
  equal sequences, by subscriber registration order. `:attempts` is the total number of attempts
  made. `:reason` is the term from `{:error, reason}` when the handler returned one, or
  `{:raised, Exception.message(e)}` when the handler raised `e`.
* `reset() :: :ok` — return the whole subsystem to a pristine state: no subscribers, no pending
  deliveries, no dead letters, no stored outbox entries, and both counters rewound so the next entry
  gets `sequence: 1` and `aggregate_sequence: 1`.

Handlers receive the `Outbox.Eventing.Event` struct itself.

**Queries and replay.** `Outbox.Eventing` must expose:

* `list_events!() :: [Event.t()]` — all stored entries, ascending by `sequence`.
* `events_for!(aggregate_type :: String.t(), aggregate_id :: String.t()) :: [Event.t()]` — entries for
  one aggregate, ascending by `aggregate_sequence`.
* `replay(after_sequence :: integer(), subscriber_id :: atom()) :: {:ok, [integer()]}` — performs the
  replay described above and returns the delivered sequences in ascending order. An unknown
  subscriber id yields `{:ok, []}` and delivers nothing. It must be backed by a generic action named
  `:replay` on `Outbox.Eventing.Event` that takes the arguments `:after_sequence` and
  `:subscriber_id` in that order.

**Batch entry points.** Add a module `Outbox.Ledger.BulkOps` with:

* `open_many(inputs :: [map()]) :: {:ok, [Outbox.Ledger.Account.t()]}` — creates every account in
  `inputs` (maps with `:owner_id`, `:name` and optionally `:balance`) with a single Ash batch create,
  returning the created records in any order.
* `freeze_many(accounts :: [Outbox.Ledger.Account.t()]) :: {:ok, [Outbox.Ledger.Account.t()]}` —
  applies the `:freeze` action to every given account with a single Ash batch update, returning the
  updated records in any order.

Both must produce exactly one outbox entry per record they write.
