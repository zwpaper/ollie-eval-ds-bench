# Fleet Rollout Orchestration with Ash.Reactor

## Background

`Orchestra` is an internal control plane that rolls new software out onto a fleet of edge nodes.
A rollout has to reserve capacity on every target node, obtain an approval, deploy to the nodes,
and — if anything goes wrong at any point — put the whole fleet back exactly the way it was.

The persistence layer is `Ash.DataLayer.Ets`, which has **no transactions**. Nothing can be
rolled back by the database: every reversal has to be performed explicitly by the workflow itself,
including reversing work that had already completed successfully when a *later* step failed.

Your job is to build the domain and the orchestration graph. Everything runs locally in this
container; there are no external services and no network access.

## Requirements

Build an Ash domain describing the fleet, and an `Ash.Reactor` workflow that orchestrates a
rollout end to end with correct failure, retry and rollback semantics, an observable execution
trace, and bounded parallelism.

The workflow must be able to:

- reserve capacity on many nodes at once and fail cleanly when a node cannot supply it,
- branch on the size of the rollout to decide what kind of approval is required,
- deploy to the nodes with bounded parallelism, retrying an attempt that fails transiently,
- reverse *in-flight* work when an attempt fails, and reverse *already-completed* work when the
  rollout as a whole fails,
- and expose an ordered trace of what happened that an operator (and the tests) can inspect.

## Implementation Hints

- Project path: `/home/user/orchestra`. The mix project, its pinned dependencies and
  `lib/orchestra/application.ex` already exist and are pre-compiled; there is no network access,
  so do not add dependencies. Elixir 1.18.4 / OTP 27.3.4, `ash` 3.31.0, `reactor` 1.0.5.
- The OTP application is `:orchestra` and `config/config.exs` already declares
  `config :orchestra, ash_domains: [Orchestra.Fleet]`.
- `mix compile` must succeed with no compilation errors.

### Domain and resources

Define the domain `Orchestra.Fleet` and five resources, all on `Ash.DataLayer.Ets`. Attribute
names, types and defaults are fixed because the tests read them directly:

`Orchestra.Fleet.Node`
: `id` (uuid primary key), `name` (`:string`), `region` (`:atom`, one of `:us_east`, `:eu_west`,
  `:ap_south`), `slots_total` (`:integer`), `slots_used` (`:integer`, default `0`), `state`
  (`:atom`, one of `:idle`, `:reserved`, `:live`, default `:idle`), `deploy_failures_remaining`
  (`:integer`, default `0`).

`Orchestra.Fleet.Rollout`
: `id` (uuid primary key), `name` (`:string`), `strategy` (`:atom`, one of `:canary`, `:blast`),
  `status` (`:atom`, one of `:pending`, `:running`, `:succeeded`, `:rolled_back`, default
  `:pending`), `deployed_node_count` (`:integer`, default `0`).

`Orchestra.Fleet.Placement`
: `id` (uuid primary key), `rollout_id` (`:uuid`), `node_name` (`:string`), `slots` (`:integer`),
  `status` (`:atom`, one of `:reserved`, `:deploying`, `:deployed`, `:released`, default
  `:reserved`), `attempts` (`:integer`, default `0`), `compensations` (`:integer`, default `0`),
  `undos` (`:integer`, default `0`).

`Orchestra.Fleet.Approval`
: `id` (uuid primary key), `rollout_id` (`:uuid`), `level` (`:atom`, one of `:auto`, `:board`),
  `slots` (`:integer`), `status` (`:atom`, one of `:granted`, `:revoked`, default `:granted`).

`Orchestra.Fleet.Lease`
: `id` (uuid primary key), `rollout_name` (`:string`), `status` (`:atom`, one of `:held`,
  `:released`, default `:held`).

The domain must expose exactly these code-interface functions (bang variants included):

- `Orchestra.Fleet.register_node/3` — positional args `name`, `region`, `slots_total`; the
  optional params map may additionally carry `deploy_failures_remaining`.
- `Orchestra.Fleet.get_node/1` — fetch a single node by `name`.
- `Orchestra.Fleet.list_nodes/0`, `Orchestra.Fleet.list_rollouts/0`,
  `Orchestra.Fleet.list_placements/0`, `Orchestra.Fleet.list_approvals/0`,
  `Orchestra.Fleet.list_leases/0` — read every record of that resource.
- `Orchestra.Fleet.plan_rollout/1` — a **generic action** taking one argument `targets`
  (`{:array, :map}`).

`plan_rollout/1` returns `{:ok, %{total_slots: integer, node_names: [String.t()],
target_count: integer}}` where `node_names` is sorted ascending. It must instead return
`{:error, %Ash.Error.Invalid{}}` whose `errors` list contains an
`%Ash.Error.Action.InvalidArgument{field: :targets}` when `targets` is empty, when any element's
`slots` is not a positive integer, or when a node name appears more than once.

### The workflow

`Orchestra.Rollout.Reactor` is executed by the tests as
`Reactor.run(Orchestra.Rollout.Reactor, inputs)` where `inputs` is a map with exactly the keys
`:rollout_name` (`String.t()`), `:strategy` (`:canary` or `:blast`), `:targets` and
`:board_threshold` (integer). `:targets` is an ordered list of maps with the atom keys
`:node_name` (`String.t()`) and `:slots` (positive integer).

On success it must return `{:ok, result}` where `result` is a map with exactly the keys
`:rollout_id` (the created rollout's id), `:status` (always `:succeeded`), `:deployed_nodes`
(the target node names, sorted ascending), `:total_slots`, `:approval_level` (`:auto` or
`:board`) and `:summary`. `:summary` must equal, with no leading or trailing whitespace:

```
Rollout <rollout_name> deployed <target count> node(s) in <strategy> mode with <approval level> approval.
```

On any failure it must return an `{:error, _}` tuple.

Observable behaviour the tests rely on:

1. Exactly one `Lease` is created per run, with `rollout_name` set from the input. Whatever
   happens, by the time the run returns its `status` is `:released`.
2. Exactly one `Rollout` is created per run, with `name` and `strategy` from the input. On
   success it ends as `status: :succeeded` with `deployed_node_count` equal to the number of
   targets. On failure it ends as `status: :rolled_back` with `deployed_node_count` `0`.
3. For every target, capacity is reserved on the named node: the node's `slots_used` grows by the
   target's `slots` and its `state` becomes `:reserved`, and one `Placement` is created carrying
   the rollout's id, the node name and the slot count. Reserving more slots than a node has free
   (`slots_used + slots > slots_total`) must fail the run, and so must naming a node that does
   not exist. Reservations are not retried.
4. No deployment may begin until every reservation has succeeded.
5. Exactly one `Approval` is created per run, carrying the rollout's id and `slots` equal to the
   total slot count. Its `level` is `:board` when the total slot count is greater than or equal
   to `:board_threshold`, and `:auto` otherwise. On success it ends `:granted`; if the rollout
   fails it ends `:revoked`. The approval must be produced by a **separate, independently
   runnable** reactor `Orchestra.Rollout.ApprovalReactor`, which the tests also execute directly
   as `Reactor.run(Orchestra.Rollout.ApprovalReactor, %{rollout_id: id, total_slots: n,
   board_threshold: t})` and which must return `{:ok, %Orchestra.Fleet.Approval{}}`. That
   reactor must choose the level with Reactor's `switch` step.
6. Deploying one target is the responsibility of `Orchestra.Rollout.Steps.DeployNode`, a module
   implementing the `Reactor.Step` behaviour with `run/3`, `compensate/4` and `undo/4`.
7. Every deployment attempt takes at least 50 ms of wall-clock time, raises the target's
   `Placement.attempts` by one and sets its `status` to `:deploying`.
8. An attempt fails if and only if the node's `deploy_failures_remaining` is greater than `0`
   when the attempt begins; a failing attempt reduces `deploy_failures_remaining` by one.
   A successful attempt sets the placement `status` to `:deployed` and the node `state` to
   `:live`.
9. A failed attempt is compensated: the placement's `compensations` rises by one and its `status`
   returns to `:reserved`. The deployment is then retried, but a target is attempted **at most
   four times in total**; a node whose `deploy_failures_remaining` is `3` therefore ends up
   deployed, while `4` fails the run.
10. When the run fails, everything already done must be undone. Each placement whose deployment
    had succeeded gets `undos` raised by one and `status` set to `:released` — a placement that
    never deployed successfully keeps `undos` at `0`. Every reservation is reversed: the node's
    `slots_used` returns to its previous value and, once it reaches `0`, its `state` returns to
    `:idle`. Placement rows are never deleted.
11. Rollback of completed work only starts once the failing target has used up its attempts.
12. At most two deployments may be in flight at any instant, and the workflow must actually use
    that budget: with six targets the tests require the maximum observed overlap to be exactly
    two.

### Structure the tests introspect

The tests read the reactor back with `Reactor.Info` and walk its steps, including nested ones.
The following must hold:

- All resource work other than deploying an individual node is carried out by `Ash.Reactor`'s
  resource-action step types rather than by calling Ash from inside plain step code: the reactor
  must contain at least one create step, one update step, one read step and one generic-action
  step.
- The targets are iterated with a map step, and `Orchestra.Rollout.ApprovalReactor` is embedded
  with a compose step.
- `Orchestra.Rollout.ApprovalReactor` picks the approval level with a switch step.

### The trace

`Orchestra.Rollout.Trace` must expose `reset/0` (clears the trace and returns `:ok`) and
`entries/0`, which returns the recorded entries **in the order they were recorded** as a list of
`{event :: atom, label :: String.t()}` tuples. It must be usable from any process, including the
processes Reactor spawns for asynchronous steps, and it must be running as soon as the
application has started.

`Orchestra.Rollout.Reactor` must be fitted with a `Reactor.Middleware` module of your own that
records:

- `{:reactor_init, "reactor"}`, `{:reactor_complete, "reactor"}` and `{:reactor_error, "reactor"}`
  for the corresponding middleware lifecycle callbacks, and
- one entry per step event the middleware is handed, where `event` is the event's tag (the atom
  itself, or the first element when the event is a tuple) and `label` is `inspect/1` of the
  step's name.

The workflow itself must additionally record, with the node's `name` as the label:

- `{:deploy_enter, name}` immediately before each deployment attempt starts its work and
  `{:deploy_exit, name}` once that attempt has finished, whether it succeeded or failed;
- `{:deploy_compensate, name}` once per compensated failed attempt;
- `{:deploy_undo, name}` once per already-successful deployment that gets rolled back;
- `{:reserve_undo, name}` once per reservation that gets rolled back.
