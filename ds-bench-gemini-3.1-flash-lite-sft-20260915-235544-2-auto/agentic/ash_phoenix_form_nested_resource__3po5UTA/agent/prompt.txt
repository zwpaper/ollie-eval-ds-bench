# Server-driven nested order forms with Ash Framework v3

## Background

`Catering` is an Elixir application built on **Ash Framework 3.31.0** with the
**ash_phoenix 2.3.24** form layer. Its domain `Catering.Orders` already models a catering
order graph and is fully implemented — do **not** change it:

- `Catering.Orders.Order` — attributes `reference` (string, required), `note` (string),
  `delivery_windows` (list of the embedded resource `Catering.Orders.DeliveryWindow`) and
  `fulfillment` (a tagged union whose members are the embedded resources
  `Catering.Orders.CourierDrop` and `Catering.Orders.CounterPickup`); a `belongs_to :customer`
  and a `has_many :line_items`. Its create action is `:place` and its update action is `:revise`.
- `Catering.Orders.LineItem` — `dish` (string, required), `quantity` (integer, must be positive),
  `position` (integer); `belongs_to :order`, `has_many :modifiers`.
- `Catering.Orders.Modifier` — `label` (string, required), `surcharge_cents` (integer, must not be
  negative), `position` (integer); `belongs_to :line_item`.
- `Catering.Orders.Customer` — `name` and `email` (both strings, required).

The `:place` and `:revise` actions already manage the whole `Order -> LineItem -> Modifier`
graph, the embedded delivery windows, the fulfillment union and the customer (which may either be
created inline from its attributes or matched to an already stored customer) from a single set of
submitted parameters, and they derive each child's `position` from the order in which the children
are submitted.

The LiveView layer that will consume this is not part of this task: everything must be reachable
through plain function calls, with no HTTP server and no browser.

## Requirements

Create `Catering.Forms`, a single facade module that a LiveView would use to build, mutate,
inspect and submit the whole nested order form. It must expose exactly these functions:

1. `new_order_form/0` — a blank create form for the order graph.
2. `edit_order_form/1` — takes an order id and returns an update form for the stored order,
   including nested forms for its existing line items and their modifiers.
3. `to_phoenix_form/1` — the `%Phoenix.HTML.Form{}` for a form.
4. `change/2` and `change/3` — revalidate a form against a fresh parameter map, with an optional
   keyword list of validation options.
5. `add_nested/2` and `add_nested/3` — add a nested form at a path, with an optional keyword list
   of options.
6. `remove_nested/2` — remove the nested form at a path.
7. `reorder/3` — reorder the nested list at a path, given the new ordering as a list of the
   current zero-based indices.
8. `move/3` — move the single nested form at a path one slot earlier (`:up`) or later (`:down`).
9. `submitted_params/1` — the parameter map that would be sent to the underlying action.
10. `hidden_inputs/2` — the hidden inputs required to render the form at a path.
11. `error_map/1` — the user-facing errors of the whole form tree.
12. `raw_error_list/2` — the untranslated errors of the form at a path.
13. `serialize/1` — a deterministic, plain-data snapshot of the whole form tree.
14. `save/2` — submit the form and persist the whole graph.

## Implementation Hints

- Project path: `/home/user/catering`. Write the module to
  `/home/user/catering/lib/catering/forms.ex`. A stub of that file already exists; replace it.
  Do not add or remove dependencies, and do not modify anything under
  `/home/user/catering/lib/catering/orders/` or `/home/user/catering/lib/catering/orders.ex`.
  The environment is offline; everything needed is already vendored and compiled.
- Every form-valued function returns an `%AshPhoenix.Form{}` struct (never a
  `%Phoenix.HTML.Form{}`), except `to_phoenix_form/1`.
- The root form is named `order`: `form.name` and `form.id` are both `"order"`, so its nested
  forms are named `order[line_items][0]`, `order[line_items][0][modifiers][1]`,
  `order[delivery_windows][0]`, `order[customer]` and `order[fulfillment]`. A blank
  `new_order_form/0` must expose exactly the nested-form keys `:customer`, `:delivery_windows`,
  `:fulfillment` and `:line_items`.
- Every `path` argument of `add_nested`, `remove_nested`, `reorder`, `move`, `hidden_inputs` and
  `raw_error_list` is one of those full HTML names as a `String.t()`, rooted at `"order"` — for
  example `"order[line_items]"`, `"order[line_items][0][modifiers]"` or
  `"order[line_items][0][modifiers][1]"`. `"order"` itself refers to the root form. Paths at any
  depth must work.
- `new_order_form/0` builds a create form for `Catering.Orders.Order`'s `:place` action;
  `edit_order_form/1` builds an update form for the `:revise` action of the order with that id.
- The third argument of `change/3` and `add_nested/3` is a keyword list that must be forwarded
  unchanged to the underlying ash_phoenix operation; callers rely on options that hide errors,
  restrict validation to touched fields, seed the new nested form with parameters, insert it at
  the front of the list, or give it a non-default action type. Both functions must also be
  callable at the lower arity with the options defaulting to `[]`.
- `reorder/3` and `move/3` change the visible order **and** the order that will be submitted: the
  reordered children must appear in the new order in `submitted_params/1`, they must be renamed to
  their new indices, and `save/2` must persist the new order. `move/3` at either boundary of a list
  is a no-op.
- `edit_order_form/1` must present nested children in ascending stored `position`, independently of
  the order the storage engine happens to return them in.
- Removing a nested form from an edit form and saving must destroy exactly that stored record,
  leaving unrelated records untouched.
- `save/2` takes the form and either a parameter map (which must be validated into the form before
  submitting) or `nil` (submit what the form already holds). On success it returns
  `{:ok, order}` where `order` is the persisted `Catering.Orders.Order` struct with `customer`,
  `line_items` and each line item's `modifiers` already loaded, and with the line items and the
  modifiers in ascending `position`. On failure it returns `{:error, form}` where `form` is the
  re-usable `%AshPhoenix.Form{}` carrying the errors, and nothing has been written.
- `hidden_inputs/2` returns a `%{String.t() => String.t()}` map: every hidden input key (including
  the form-type marker `_form_type`, the touched-field marker `_touched`, the primary key of an
  existing record, and the union member marker `_union_type`) mapped to its string value.
- `error_map/1` returns a `%{String.t() => [[String.t()]]}` map, keyed by the **HTML name of the
  form that owns the errors** (`"order"`, `"order[line_items][0]"`, …). Each value is the list of
  that form's own errors as two-element lists `[field_name, message]`, sorted ascending. Forms
  without errors must be absent from the map.
- `raw_error_list/2` returns the errors of the form at `path` as a list of
  `{field :: atom(), message :: String.t(), vars :: keyword()}` tuples with the message left
  untranslated (substitution variables not interpolated), sorted ascending by field name and then
  by message.
- `serialize/1` returns, for the form it is given and recursively for every nested form, a map with
  exactly these string keys:
  - `"name"` — the form's HTML name.
  - `"id"` — the form's HTML id.
  - `"type"` — `"create"`, `"update"` or `"read"`.
  - `"resource"` — the form's resource module rendered with `inspect/1`, e.g.
    `"Catering.Orders.LineItem"`.
  - `"valid"` — the form's validity as a boolean.
  - `"hidden"` — the same map as `hidden_inputs/2` would return for this form, but **without** the
    `_touched` entry.
  - `"values"` — a map from field name to the form's current value for that field, rendered with
    `to_string/1`, or `nil` when the value is `nil`. The fields are, per resource:
    `Order` → `reference`, `note`; `LineItem` → `dish`, `quantity`; `Modifier` → `label`,
    `surcharge_cents`; `Customer` → `name`, `email`; `DeliveryWindow` → `label`,
    `starts_at_minute`, `ends_at_minute`; `CourierDrop` → `street`, `postcode`;
    `CounterPickup` → `counter`.
  - `"errors"` — this form's own errors as two-element lists `[field_name, message]`, sorted
    ascending.
  - `"nested"` — a map whose keys are the string names of the nested-form keys that this form
    currently holds forms for, and whose values are the serialized child (for a single nested
    form), the list of serialized children in order (for a list of nested forms), or `nil`.
