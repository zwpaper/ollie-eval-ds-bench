# Frame-Based Cooperative Coroutine Scheduler (GDScript)

## Background
Godot 4 replaced the old `yield` with the `await` keyword for GDScript coroutines. You will build a
deterministic, frame-based cooperative task scheduler in pure GDScript that can suspend and resume
multiple coroutine tasks across simulated frames — without using the engine's real main loop, real
timers, or wall-clock time. It must run headless.

- Godot version: **4.3-stable** (run headless via `godot --headless`).
- Project path: `/home/user/godot_coroutine_scheduler`
- Fully offline. Do NOT use networking, `OS` time, real `SceneTreeTimer`/timeout, engine process
  frames, or any wall-clock source. ALL timing MUST be driven solely by the scheduler's own
  `advance()` calls, so the result is byte-for-byte reproducible on every run.

## Requirements
Implement a scheduler that lets multiple GDScript coroutine tasks run cooperatively across discrete,
simulated frames. It must support:
- Spawning tasks (each task is a coroutine function).
- A task suspending itself for a fixed number of frames.
- A task suspending itself until an arbitrary condition becomes true.
- A task suspending itself until a custom Godot `Signal` is emitted.
- Per-task completion callbacks.
- Deterministic resume ordering when several tasks become ready on the same frame.
- Advancing the simulation by a fixed number of frames, producing a fully deterministic interleaving.

## Deliverable
Create the script `/home/user/godot_coroutine_scheduler/scheduler/frame_scheduler.gd`
(i.e. `res://scheduler/frame_scheduler.gd`) declaring `class_name FrameScheduler` and
`extends RefCounted`.

## Scheduler API (exact contract)
Your class MUST expose exactly this public surface with these exact names and signatures:

- `var current_frame: int` — the current simulated frame; MUST be `0` before the first `advance()`.
- `func spawn(task_name: String, body: Callable, on_complete: Callable = Callable()) -> void`
  - Registers and immediately starts a task. Tasks are assigned integer ids in spawn order,
    starting at `0`.
  - The body starts running synchronously during `spawn()` (at the current value of
    `current_frame`) and runs until its first suspension or its completion.
  - When the body returns, if `on_complete` is valid it MUST be called exactly once with a single
    `String` argument equal to `task_name`.
- `func wait_frames(n: int) -> void` — coroutine helper; suspends the calling task for exactly `n`
  frames (`n >= 1`). If called when `current_frame == F`, the task becomes ready on frame `F + n`.
- `func wait_until(cond: Callable) -> void` — coroutine helper; suspends the calling task until
  `cond.call()` returns `true`. `cond` is evaluated at the task's consideration point on each frame.
- `func wait_signal(sig: Signal) -> void` — coroutine helper; suspends the calling task until `sig`
  is emitted; the task becomes ready on the frame during which the emission occurs.
- `func advance(frames: int) -> void` — advances the simulation by `frames` frames.

## Deterministic execution semantics (exact contract)
- `current_frame` starts at `0`.
- `advance(k)` performs, `k` times in order: increment `current_frame` by `1`, then consider every
  not-yet-finished, currently-suspended task exactly once, in ascending task-id (spawn) order. A
  considered task resumes on this frame if and only if:
  - it is waiting via `wait_frames` and its target frame equals `current_frame`; or
  - it is waiting via `wait_until` and `cond.call()` returns `true` at the moment it is considered; or
  - it is waiting via `wait_signal` and its signal has been emitted at any point since that wait
    began, up to and including this consideration point.
- Resumption is synchronous: a resumed task runs until its next suspension or its completion before
  the next task in the same frame is considered. Consequently, state changes and signal emissions
  performed by an earlier (lower-id) task are visible to later (higher-id) tasks considered on the
  same frame.
- A task that suspends again during a frame is NOT reconsidered until the following frame.
- On completion, the `on_complete` callback (if any) runs immediately, before the next task is
  considered.

## Grading harness (this exact scenario is run against your scheduler)
The grader supplies its own headless driver (extending `SceneTree`) that uses your `FrameScheduler`.
It defines the shared state and four task bodies below, spawns them in the order A, B, C, D, then
calls `advance(7)`. Each task appends event strings of the form `"<current_frame>|<TASK>|<label>"`
to a shared array `events`, reading the frame number from your scheduler's `current_frame`. The
completion callback appends `"<current_frame>|<TASK>|complete"`. You implement ONLY the scheduler;
you cannot influence the harness, so the transcript below is achievable only by a correct scheduler.

Shared state and helpers (conceptually):
```gdscript
var sched := FrameScheduler.new()
var events: Array = []
var gate := {"open": false}
var bus := Bus.new()          # Bus is a RefCounted defining: signal pulse

func _done(task_name): events.append("%d|%s|complete" % [sched.current_frame, task_name])
```

Task bodies:
```gdscript
func task_a():
    events.append("%d|A|start" % sched.current_frame)
    await sched.wait_frames(2)
    events.append("%d|A|resume" % sched.current_frame)
    await sched.wait_frames(2)
    events.append("%d|A|end" % sched.current_frame)

func task_b():
    events.append("%d|B|start" % sched.current_frame)
    await sched.wait_frames(1)
    events.append("%d|B|open_gate" % sched.current_frame)
    gate.open = true
    await sched.wait_frames(2)
    events.append("%d|B|pulse" % sched.current_frame)
    bus.pulse.emit()

func task_c():
    events.append("%d|C|start" % sched.current_frame)
    await sched.wait_until(func(): return gate.open)
    events.append("%d|C|gate_opened" % sched.current_frame)

func task_d():
    events.append("%d|D|start" % sched.current_frame)
    await sched.wait_signal(bus.pulse)
    events.append("%d|D|pulsed" % sched.current_frame)
    await sched.wait_frames(1)
    events.append("%d|D|end" % sched.current_frame)
```

Spawn order and driving:
```gdscript
sched.spawn("A", task_a, _done)
sched.spawn("B", task_b, _done)
sched.spawn("C", task_c, _done)
sched.spawn("D", task_d, _done)
sched.advance(7)
```

## Expected transcript (exact)
After the harness runs, the `events` array MUST equal exactly this ordered list of 15 strings:
```
0|A|start
0|B|start
0|C|start
0|D|start
1|B|open_gate
1|C|gate_opened
1|C|complete
2|A|resume
3|B|pulse
3|B|complete
3|D|pulsed
4|A|end
4|A|complete
4|D|end
4|D|complete
```
Your scheduler is the only code under evaluation and MUST make this exact transcript reproduce
deterministically on every run.
