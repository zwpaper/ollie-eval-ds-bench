# Dynamic Cart Pricing Engine (Ash Framework 3.x)

## Background

An offline Elixir project scaffold lives at `/home/user/cart_pricing` (OTP application `:cart_pricing`). It already depends on Ash 3.x, and every dependency is pre-fetched and pre-compiled. Nothing of the business domain exists yet.

Build a shopping-cart pricing engine in which **no money figure is ever stored**. Carts, cart items and coupons hold only raw facts; every subtotal, discount, tax and total is derived at read time from those facts plus load-time inputs. All money is expressed in integer cents and all percentages in basis points (`10_000` bps = 100%).

## Requirements

### Modules and files

Create exactly these modules at exactly these paths:

| Module | File |
| --- | --- |
| `CartPricing.Sales` | `lib/cart_pricing/sales.ex` |
| `CartPricing.Sales.Cart` | `lib/cart_pricing/sales/cart.ex` |
| `CartPricing.Sales.CartItem` | `lib/cart_pricing/sales/cart_item.ex` |
| `CartPricing.Sales.Coupon` | `lib/cart_pricing/sales/coupon.ex` |
| `CartPricing.Sales.Calculations.DiscountedLineTotal` | `lib/cart_pricing/sales/calculations/discounted_line_total.ex` |
| `CartPricing.Sales.Calculations.CartQuote` | `lib/cart_pricing/sales/calculations/cart_quote.ex` |

`CartPricing.Sales` is the Ash domain that owns the three resources. Every resource must persist through Ash's in-memory ETS data layer — the environment has no database and no network.

### Stored data

`CartPricing.Sales.Cart`
- `id` — UUID primary key, generated
- `reference` — string, required
- `region` — atom, required, restricted to `:us_ca`, `:us_or`, `:eu_de`, `:jp_13`
- `items` — a to-many relationship to `CartPricing.Sales.CartItem` keyed by the item's `cart_id`

`CartPricing.Sales.CartItem`
- `id` — UUID primary key, generated
- `sku` — string, required
- `unit_price_cents` — integer, required
- `quantity` — integer, required, minimum `1`
- `cart` / `cart_id` — a to-one relationship to `CartPricing.Sales.Cart`, required

`CartPricing.Sales.Coupon`
- `id` — UUID primary key, generated
- `code` — string, required
- `percent_off_bps` — integer, required
- `starts_at` — UTC datetime, required
- `ends_at` — UTC datetime, required
- `max_redemptions` — integer, nullable (`nil` means unlimited)
- `redemption_count` — integer, required, default `0`
- `min_subtotal_cents` — integer, required, default `0`
- `max_discount_cents` — integer, nullable (`nil` means uncapped)

### Derived fields on `CartPricing.Sales.CartItem`

- `line_total_cents` — integer, equal to `unit_price_cents * quantity`. It must be usable directly inside a query filter and inside a query sort.
- `tier_discount_bps` — integer, derived only from that item's own `quantity`: `1`–`4` → `0`; `5`–`9` → `500`; `10`–`24` → `1000`; `25` or more → `1500`. It must also be usable directly inside a query filter.
- `discounted_line_total_cents` — integer, equal to `line_total_cents` minus `floor(line_total_cents * tier_discount_bps / 10_000)`. Its value must be produced by `CartPricing.Sales.Calculations.DiscountedLineTotal`, and asking for it alone on a record that was fetched with nothing else loaded or selected must still yield the correct number.

### Derived fields on `CartPricing.Sales.Cart`

- `item_count` — integer, the number of items belonging to the cart. It must be usable directly inside a query filter.
- `pricing_quote` — a value of Ash type `:map`, produced by `CartPricing.Sales.Calculations.CartQuote`, accepting two load-time inputs:
  - `coupon_code` — string, optional, defaulting to `nil`
  - `as_of` — UTC datetime, required

  Its value must be a map whose key set is exactly
  `:gross_subtotal_cents`, `:tier_discount_cents`, `:subtotal_cents`, `:coupon_status`, `:coupon_discount_cents`, `:discounted_subtotal_cents`, `:tax_cents`, `:total_cents`, `:item_count`.
  Every value except `:coupon_status` must satisfy `is_integer/1`. `:coupon_status` must be one of the atoms `:none`, `:not_found`, `:not_yet_active`, `:expired`, `:exhausted`, `:below_minimum`, `:applied`.

### Pricing contract

For one cart, given `coupon_code` and `as_of`:

1. `gross_subtotal_cents` — the sum of `line_total_cents` over the cart's items.
2. `subtotal_cents` — the sum of `discounted_line_total_cents` over the cart's items.
3. `tier_discount_cents` — `gross_subtotal_cents - subtotal_cents`.
4. `item_count` — the number of items in the cart.
5. `coupon_status` and `coupon_discount_cents` are resolved by the **first** matching rule in this exact order, where a coupon matches when its `code` is exactly equal to `coupon_code`:
   1. `coupon_code` is `nil` → `:none`, discount `0`
   2. no coupon has that code → `:not_found`, discount `0`
   3. `as_of` is strictly before `starts_at` → `:not_yet_active`, discount `0`
   4. `as_of` is strictly after `ends_at` → `:expired`, discount `0`
   5. `max_redemptions` is not `nil` and `redemption_count` is greater than or equal to `max_redemptions` → `:exhausted`, discount `0`
   6. `subtotal_cents` is strictly less than `min_subtotal_cents` → `:below_minimum`, discount `0`
   7. otherwise → `:applied`, discount `floor(subtotal_cents * percent_off_bps / 10_000)`, then reduced to `max_discount_cents` if that field is not `nil` and the computed discount exceeds it

   The validity window is inclusive at both ends.
6. `discounted_subtotal_cents` — `subtotal_cents - coupon_discount_cents`.
7. `tax_cents` — the exact rational number `discounted_subtotal_cents * rate_bps / 10_000` converted to a whole number of cents using the cart region's rate and rounding rule:

   | `region` | `rate_bps` | rounding |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | `:us_ca` | `925` | half away from zero |
   | `:us_or` | `0` | half away from zero |
   | `:eu_de` | `1900` | half to even |
   | `:jp_13` | `1000` | truncate toward zero |

8. `total_cents` — `discounted_subtotal_cents + tax_cents`.

Every step is exact integer arithmetic. The checked inputs include values where floating-point evaluation and the three rounding rules all disagree, so an inexact or uniformly-rounded implementation produces wrong numbers.

An empty cart produces `0` for every integer key, and its `coupon_status` is still resolved by the rules above against a `subtotal_cents` of `0`.

### Loading contract

- `pricing_quote` must be obtainable while reading carts *and* on `%CartPricing.Sales.Cart{}` structs that were already fetched with no loads at all.
- Loading a list of carts in one operation must give every cart its own quote, correctly paired with that cart, whatever order the carts were read in.
- The same cart or list of carts must be loadable more than once with different `coupon_code` / `as_of` inputs, each load returning results for the inputs it was given.

## Implementation Hints

- Project path: `/home/user/cart_pricing`
- The machine is offline. Every dependency you need is already fetched and compiled into the project; do not add, remove or upgrade dependencies, and do not attempt to reach the network.
- `mix compile` and `MIX_ENV=test mix compile` must both succeed from the project root with no errors.
- Resources must carry their own domain, so that plain `Ash.read!/2`, `Ash.load!/3` and `Ash.Changeset` calls work on them without passing a `:domain` option.
- `CartPricing.Sales` must expose these functions, each taking a map of attributes and raising on failure: `create_cart!/1`, `create_cart_item!/1`, `create_coupon!/1`. It must also expose `get_cart!/1`, which takes a cart `id` and returns that cart. The create functions must accept every attribute listed above for their resource.
- Invalid writes must be rejected: creating a cart with a `region` outside the allowed set, or a cart item with `quantity` below `1`, must fail rather than persist.
- Verification copies additional ExUnit files into `test/` of this project and runs `mix test`, replacing `test/test_helper.exs`. Leave the project in a state where `mix test` can run.
