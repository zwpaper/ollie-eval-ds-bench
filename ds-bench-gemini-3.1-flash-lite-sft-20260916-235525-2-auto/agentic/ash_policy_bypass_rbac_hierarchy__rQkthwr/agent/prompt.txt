# Hierarchical Organisation RBAC with Ash Policies

## Background

`OrgGuard` is the access-control core of a document vault used by a large company. Documents belong
to org units, org units form a tree, and the right to act on a document is inherited down that tree
from role grants — but a lower org unit may also *revoke* an inherited role for a specific person.
Security staff need a break-glass path, suspended accounts must be locked out immediately, and
budget figures must stay invisible to people who are not allowed to see money.

You must implement this authorization engine with Ash Framework 3.31.0 on top of an in-memory data
layer. The project already exists and its dependencies are vendored; the container has **no network
access**, so do not attempt to add or fetch dependencies.

## Requirements

### Project

- Project path: `/home/user/orgguard` (OTP app `:orgguard`).
- Everything you write must compile with `mix compile` offline, in both the `dev` and `test` Mix
  environments.
- The domain module is `OrgGuard.Access`. All four resources below must be registered on it.
- Every resource must use `Ash.DataLayer.Ets`, and its storage must be **shared between processes**:
  the verifier seeds records from one process and asserts from other processes.

### Resources

Create exactly these four resources with exactly these names, attributes, types, constraints and
actions. Every attribute listed is public. Every action listed must be the primary action of its
type on that resource.

`OrgGuard.Access.User`

- `id` — uuid primary key
- `email` — `:string`, required
- `status` — `:atom`, required, default `:active`, constrained to `[:active, :suspended]`
- `global_role` — `:atom`, required, default `:member`, constrained to `[:member, :break_glass]`
- actions: read `:read`; create `:create` accepting `email`, `status`, `global_role`

`OrgGuard.Access.OrgUnit`

- `id` — uuid primary key
- `code` — `:string`, required
- `name` — `:string`, required
- an optional self-referential `belongs_to` relationship named `:parent` pointing at
  `OrgGuard.Access.OrgUnit`, whose source attribute is `parent_id` and which is writable through the
  create action, plus the matching `has_many` named `:children`
- actions: read `:read`; create `:create` accepting `code`, `name`, `parent_id`

`OrgGuard.Access.RoleAssignment`

- `id` — uuid primary key
- `role` — `:atom`, required, constrained to `[:viewer, :editor, :auditor, :unit_admin]`
- `effect` — `:atom`, required, default `:grant`, constrained to `[:grant, :deny]`
- required `belongs_to` relationships `:user` (source attribute `user_id`) and `:org_unit` (source
  attribute `org_unit_id`), both writable through the create action
- actions: read `:read`; create `:create` accepting `user_id`, `org_unit_id`, `role`, `effect`

`OrgGuard.Access.Document`

- `id` — uuid primary key
- `title` — `:string`, required
- `budget_cents` — `:integer`, required, default `0`
- required `belongs_to` relationship `:org_unit` (source attribute `org_unit_id`), writable through
  the create action
- actions:
  - read `:read`
  - create `:create` accepting `title`, `budget_cents`, `org_unit_id`
  - update `:update` accepting `title`, `budget_cents`
  - destroy `:destroy`
  - generic action `:relocate`, whose return type is `:struct` constrained to instances of
    `OrgGuard.Access.Document`, taking two required `:uuid` arguments, `document_id` and
    `target_org_unit_id`. When it is allowed to run, it moves the identified document to the target
    org unit and returns the updated document; when it is not allowed to run, the document's
    `org_unit_id` must be left untouched.
- `OrgGuard.Access.Document` must be authorized by `Ash.Policy.Authorizer`. The other three
  resources must remain freely accessible (no authorizer).

### Domain code interface

`OrgGuard.Access` must define these code-interface functions, so that the verifier can call them and
so that Ash's generated `can_*?` helpers exist:

| function | resource | action | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `create_user` | User | `:create` | |
| `get_user` | User | `:read` | fetched by `:id` |
| `create_org_unit` | OrgUnit | `:create` | |
| `get_org_unit` | OrgUnit | `:read` | fetched by `:id` |
| `create_role_assignment` | RoleAssignment | `:create` | |
| `list_role_assignments` | RoleAssignment | `:read` | |
| `create_document` | Document | `:create` | |
| `list_documents` | Document | `:read` | |
| `get_document` | Document | `:read` | fetched by `:id` |
| `update_document` | Document | `:update` | |
| `destroy_document` | Document | `:destroy` | |
| `relocate_document` | Document | `:relocate` | positional args, in the order `document_id`, `target_org_unit_id` |

The verifier calls them as `OrgGuard.Access.list_documents(actor: actor)`,
`OrgGuard.Access.get_document(id, actor: actor)`,
`OrgGuard.Access.update_document(document, %{title: "…"}, actor: actor)`,
`OrgGuard.Access.destroy_document(document, actor: actor)`,
`OrgGuard.Access.relocate_document(document_id, target_org_unit_id, actor: actor)`,
`OrgGuard.Access.create_document(%{…}, actor: actor)`, and the corresponding
`OrgGuard.Access.can_update_document?/2`, `can_destroy_document?/2`, `can_create_document?/2`,
`can_relocate_document?/3` helpers. It seeds fixtures through the same functions with
`authorize?: false`, which must always succeed and must always return real (unmasked) attribute
values.

### Capabilities

Each role confers exactly this set of capabilities:

| role | capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| `:viewer` | `read` |
| `:editor` | `read`, `write` |
| `:auditor` | `read`, `view_budget` |
| `:unit_admin` | `read`, `write`, `delete`, `relocate`, `view_budget` |

### Permission resolution (this precedence is normative)

An actor's effective roles at an org unit `U` are resolved per role, independently, as follows.

1. Build the path `U`, `parent(U)`, `parent(parent(U))`, …, up to the root — nearest unit first.
2. For role `R`, walk that path from nearest to root and stop at the **first** unit that carries at
   least one `RoleAssignment` for this actor with that role.
3. If no unit on the path carries such an assignment, the actor does not hold `R` at `U`.
4. If the stopping unit carries **any** assignment for this actor and role with `effect: :deny`,
   the actor does not hold `R` at `U` — even if an ancestor granted it, and even if the same unit
   also carries a `:grant` for it.
5. Otherwise the actor holds `R` at `U`.

The actor's capabilities at `U` are the union of the capabilities of every role held at `U`. A grant
therefore flows down the whole subtree, a deny at a descendant cuts it off for that subtree, and a
grant deeper still re-establishes it.

### Authorization contracts

These are the observable outcomes the verifier checks. `nil` below means no actor was supplied.

**Break-glass.** An actor whose `global_role` is `:break_glass` may read, create, update, destroy
and relocate every document, and sees every `budget_cents` value, regardless of role assignments —
and this holds even when that actor's `status` is `:suspended`. `Document`'s policies must contain
at least one bypass policy.

**Suspension.** For any other actor whose `status` is `:suspended`, every document operation fails
with `Ash.Error.Forbidden` — including list reads and fetches by id, and including operations the
actor's roles would otherwise permit.

**Reads.** For a non-suspended, non-break-glass actor, a list read returns exactly the documents
whose org unit grants the actor the `read` capability; it never returns an error, not even for
`nil` and not even when the actor holds no roles at all (it returns an empty list instead). Fetching
a single document by id fails with `Ash.Error.Query.NotFound` when the actor lacks `read` on it, and
succeeds when the actor has it.

**Updates.** An update requires the `write` capability at the document's org unit. An update that
changes `budget_cents` additionally requires the `view_budget` capability at that org unit. Denied
updates fail with `Ash.Error.Forbidden`.

**Creates.** Creating a document requires the `write` capability at the org unit named by the
submitted `org_unit_id`. Denied creates fail with `Ash.Error.Forbidden`.

**Destroys.** Destroying a document requires the `delete` capability at the document's org unit.
Denied destroys fail with `Ash.Error.Forbidden`.

**Relocation.** `:relocate` requires the `relocate` capability at **both** the document's current
org unit **and** the target org unit. Denied relocations fail with `Ash.Error.Forbidden`.

**Budget confidentiality.** `budget_cents` is readable only by an actor with the `view_budget`
capability at that document's org unit (or by a break-glass actor). For every other actor that can
read the document, the value that comes back in place of the integer must be the documented
forbidden-field marker for that attribute. All other attributes stay visible to anyone who can read
the document.

**`can_*?` introspection.** The generated `can_*?` helpers must return `true`/`false` in agreement
with the contracts above for every actor/record/action combination, including `nil` actors.

### Check implementation constraints

- At least one check module used by `Document`'s policies must be defined by you (i.e. its module
  name must not start with `Ash.`) and must be a **filter** check.
- At least one check module used by `Document`'s policies must be defined by you and must be a
  **simple** check.
- `budget_cents` must be governed by at least one field policy.

## Implementation Hints

- Project path: `/home/user/orgguard`
- The verifier writes a self-contained Elixir script to `/tmp` and runs it with
  `mix run <script>` from `/home/user/orgguard` with `MIX_ENV=dev`. The project must therefore
  compile and boot with no network access, and `OrgGuard.Access` plus all four resource modules must
  be loadable from that script.
- Do not add, remove or upgrade dependencies, and do not change the OTP application name or the
  domain/resource module names.
- Leave `Logger` at a level no more verbose than `:warning` so the script's stdout is not flooded.
